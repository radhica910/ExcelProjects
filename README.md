**Bike Sales**

Based on my analysis of the bike sales data using Excel, I made several improvements to the dataset. I removed duplicates and created an age bracket column using the 'IF' function to categorize customers into different age groups. I also replaced the abbreviated mentions of marital status and gender with their full forms to avoid confusion during analysis. To visualize the data, I utilized a pivot table.

Upon analyzing the data, I uncovered some key findings. Firstly, males tended to purchase more bikes than females, and this trend correlated with their average income. Additionally, customers who had a commute distance of 10 miles or more were less inclined to buy bikes. Furthermore, middle-aged customers demonstrated a higher preference for purchasing bikes compared to both adolescents and older individuals.

Based on these insights, I would recommend implementing targeted marketing campaigns and promotions aimed specifically at middle-aged customers. These initiatives should emphasize innovative features and benefits that are likely to attract this demographic, such as the potential for improved fitness and health. Furthermore, providing alternative options for customers with longer commute distances, such as electric bikes, hybrid bikes, or bike rental services, could help create integrated commuting solutions.
